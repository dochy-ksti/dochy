Let's save data in Dochy.

There's two types of save files in Dochy, 
"Dochy Data" and "Dochy History".

Dochy Data saves the difference from "Dochy Src".

Simply put, Dochy History saves the difference from the previous save file.

We'll talk about Dochy History in the next section. Now let's move on.
```root.json5
{
    message : "Hello World"
}
```
This is the Dochy Src for this section.
