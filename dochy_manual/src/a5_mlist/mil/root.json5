  // Inner MList is named "Mil", which is "Mut Inner List".

  // Basically, changing C to M works, because they are very similar facially.

  // Internally, MList and Mil uses int-keyed LinkedHashMap, which is a hashmap whose items are linked-list-node,
  // so it has sequential order, and searching items by the key is very fast (because it's also a hashmap).

  // The items have ID, which is auto_increment, and assigned automatically.
  // The ID is the key, so searching items by ID in the list is very fast.
  // When calculating diff, we compare items with the same ID.

  // Let's see how to use it in the next section.
