  // Dochy Lang is a language to define static types and initial values of data
  // The source files of the language is called Dochy Src.
  // It's written in JSON5. It's an improved JSON and comments can be written in it (as you can see).

  // Firstly, you need to crate a directory to place JSON5 files. It's kind of cumbersome, but it's for scalability.
  // The directory must have "root.json5"(It's also bothersome, but it's also for scalability).

  // Let's take a look at the parameter types of Dochy Lang and how to write it.

  // Int (i64)
  int_value : 1,
  // Float (f64)
  float_value : 1.0,
  // String
  string_value : "String",

  // In Dochy Lang, ints (1) and floats (1.0) are distinguishable.
  // Right value's type determines the variable's static type.

  // Let's call Dochy Lang's parameters Dochy Params.
  // Dochy Params are

  int_array : ["IntArray", 1, 2],
  float_array : ["FloatArray", 1.0, 2], //integers can be written in FloatArray( it's converted to f64)
  binary : ["Binary"],

  // IntArray is i64's array.
  // FloatArray is f64's array.
  // Binary is u8's array.

  // Arrays and Binary need specified typename at first of the arrays.

  // You can specify types in ints, floats, and strings if you want to.
  int_sp : ["Int", 1],
  float_sp : ["Float", 1.0],
  string_value_sp : ["String", "string"],
