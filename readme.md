Dochy is like a binary diff format of static JSON, and its surrounding file system and tools.

It's intended to replace ordinary data files, 
especially for game/cloud apps which employs auto-save 
and undoable apps.

There are three goals we want to achieve.

1. [Efficiency](src/sample_test/sample_code/efficiency.md)
2. Version Awareness
3. Improved Expressiveness By Supporting Reference and Enum

### What does Dochy stand for?

DOnnani CHoushiga Yokutemo kakisugiteha ikenai
(どんなに調子が良くても書きすぎてはいけない, Don't overwork when you're really feeling good,) which is an epigram I created.

### Contribution

I'm Japanese and I desperately need proofreading of my English writing for this project,
and any other contribution is welcome.
