Dochy is like a binary diff format of static JSON, and the surrounding file system and tools.

It's intended to replace ordinary data files, 
especially for game/cloud apps which employs auto-save 
and undoable apps.

Let me introduce the key features of this project.

1. [Efficiency](src/sample_test/sample_code/efficiency.md)
2. [Version Awareness](src/sample_test/sample_code/version_awareness.md)
3. [Reference and Enum](src/sample_test/sample_code/ref_and_enum.md)

These three documents(and [this](src/sample_test/sample_code/history.md))
should work as a walkthrough of Dochy's concepts. 

[Hello World](dochy_manual/src/a1_hello_world/hello_world.md) 
explains the basics.

### What does Dochy stand for?

DOnnani CHoushiga Yokutemo kakisugiteha ikenai
(どんなに調子が良くても書きすぎてはいけない, Don't overwork when you're really feeling good,) which is an epigram I created.

### Contribution

I'm Japanese and I desperately need proofreading of my English writing for this project,
and any other contribution is welcome.
